#. with pretty typographical formatting.
#. If you use '|' characters to split the translated string into 5 parts,
#. the parts will be split onto separate lines with fancy typographic
#. formatting specific to each line (see the site for an example).
#. If this fancy formatting isn't a good fit for your language, omit the
#. '|' characters. The translated string will be displayed in full size
#. without any typographic effects.
